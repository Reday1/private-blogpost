    <h1>post1-jun-27-2024</h1>
    <p>At present i worked on this follow along tutorial kind of project that utilised javascript and connected a site to a remote server,
        But i realised i didnt know anything about javascript therefore i dropped the idea.<br>
        I am still trying to get into cybersecurity, but i realised that having knowledge about other stuff such as webdev app dev is imp . I have put the cybersecurity courses on hold as it mostly contains info about wireless network attakcs
        and my laptop's inbuilt wifi card is not up do date. The packet sending and receiving speed is quite slow.<br>
        Still contemplating whether to start a project or get back into the courses. i guess my target is going to be complete a project and complete the pending courses before sem break is over.
        I will try to weekly write into this site and take a note of my progress in tech field
